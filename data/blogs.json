You are, in effect, paying to experience something out of the ordinary and, ideally, to set eyes upon or feel something that’s worth forging new memories with.<br /><img class=\"my-3\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5856bc666a49634cd55b0ba9/1628612106161-8C29T9IZJ34GKIK168UI/retro-suites-hotel-chatham-ontario.jpg?format=2500w\" alt=\"image-1\"></img><br />This is what the Retro Suites Hotel on King Street in Chatham, Ontario very clearly understands. <br />Most notably, every room in the hotel is different and abides by a particular theme that it aims to execute to perfection. On the first visit to the Retro Suites Hotel (when Bri I were attending RetroFest), we stayed in a Superior Loft room called the “Sail Inn,” which was a romantic, nautical room. On my last visit, which I’ll be chronicling in more depth below, I was there on my own, and staying in a King Premiere room known as “Game Time,” which was, quite literally, sports heaven for me. <br />Both rooms suited me perfectly for the occasion, and that’s another thing to note right off the bat. Seriously, in how many hotels around the world can you return again and again and have a markedly different experience? <br />There are few hotels on the planet, let alone the province, that can offer such a different stay each time you visit, and that’s worth acknowledging. I already can’t wait to return again, and to choose a room based on how I’m feeling at the moment, and also how I’m hoping to feel on the trip.</p>"
